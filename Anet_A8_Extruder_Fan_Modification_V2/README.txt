# Summary

UPDATE: Thx for nearly 7k downloads, but I stoped support for this part because I sell my A8. Thank you for likes, collects, remixes and so on. Feel free for asking but I will not work longer on this mod.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second and better version of my Anet A8 Extruder Fan Modification.

Now you can open the extruder by rotate the fan to the right side.
You have to put the mod on the fan of the nozzle. Maybe you need screws wich are 5mm longer. I have luck and take my original screws.

The extruderfan and aluminium block have to be screwed with two 3x30mm screws and two 3mm nuts.
Additionally I use the Anet A8 Extruder Fan Spacer by AZDawg (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1798669) which I customized so the fan sits flush on the aluminium block.

Both Mod parts are screwd together with one 3x50mm screws and two 3mm nuts.

ATTENTION: It's important to sink in the holes of the aluminium block and the extruder block to make the screws flush with the blocks. Look at the pictures!

Maybe you have to check your extruder position, the aluminium block is supposed to be placed flat against the extruder.

EDIT: mod1V3 has stronger hinges
